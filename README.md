# SquareMeter ServicePricing
 A project for calculating service prices by square meter, applying successive discounts based on the previous post. To ensure the total price does not fall below the previous one, the successive discount is reduced after a specified number of posts. All parameters can be easily edited in config.json. Documentation is currently pending.
